# Calculator-TV-killer
This is going to be an open source battery powered calculator further more containing a IR LED To turn off LED's and such.

Calculator-TV-killer
This is my second GitHub repo so it is a work in progress but I built this calculator for schoool and to just have fun
If you have any ideas or concerns I am fully open to critisism just leave a comment! :)


CALCULATOR-TV-KILLER
GRAYSONS MACRO MACHINE is a 16 key calculator. It also has A IR LED to turn off tv's, and uses arduino IDE code

Features:
2 peice 3d printed case. Custom colors ooooohhh.
1 IR LEDs. these should work as a TV killer for TV's.
5 Keys!

Here's my PCB! It was made in KiCad.



Firmware Overview
This hackpad uses QMK firmware for everything.

I might add more in the future! That's it for now

BOM:

1;"D1,D4,D3,D2";"LED_SK6812MINI_PLCC4_3.5x3.5mm_P1.75mm";4;"SK6812MINI";;;
2;"SW1,SW3,SW5,SW2,SW4";"SW_Cherry_MX_1.00u_PCB";5;"SW_Push";;;
3;"U1";"XIAO-RP2040-DIP";1;"XIAO-RP2040-DIP";;;

(Above is the CSV version of the BOM and below is just normal)
